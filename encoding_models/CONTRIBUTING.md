# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This repository is primarily a research and portfolio project focused on encoding models and RSA analysis on fMRI data from the Algonauts 2023 Challenge.

If you would like to contribute code, documentation, or improvements, please follow the guidelines below:

## Environment Setup
Create the environment from `environment.yml`

## Code Style
- Use Python modules rather than notebooks whenever possible for reusable logic
- Keep functions pure when feasible, and separate I/O from computation
- Use descriptive function and variable names

## Pull Requests
- If making large changes, open an Issue first to discuss
- Keep PRs focused (one topic per PR)
- Include clear descriptions and motivation for the change
- Add minimal comments if behavior might be unclear to others

## Data
Do NOT commit any Algonauts dataset files due to license restrictions.
